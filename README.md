# A simple birthday greeting app for practice

## Things I learnt developing this app

1. How the project is structured
    - what's the purpose of gradle scripts
2. Develop the layout of the screens:
    - ConstraintsLayout
    - TextView
    - EditText
    - ImageView
    - Button
 3. Handle the button clicks
    - two ways to handle the button clicks; 1 through the xml onClick property and attaching the 
    function. Second by using setOnClickListener
 4. Intents
    - Use of intents and passing data between screens
 6. Companion objects
